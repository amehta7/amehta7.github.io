            Our commitment to you is that we source our coffee beans from the
            finest estates and plantations from around the world. Our team
            visits these plantations to assess and determine the quality of
            coffee before it makes it to our shortlist. Which is why we have a
            really short list, because to us, only the best matter. We also
            ensure the farms we work with are free from slave labour and any
            other malpractice and are ecologically responsible and follow
            ethical practices.

            <h2>Lima Gold Coffee Plantations, Ethiopia</h2>
            <p>
              We came across Lima Gold Plantations by chance during our visit to
              Ethiopia in 2018. Ever since then, we’ve been mesmerized by the
              blends from this amazing estate. And your love for unique blends
              from this plantation makes our association strong.

            <h2>Attaca Estate, Brazil</h2>
            <p>
              This popular estate was the subject of intrigue after a number of
              UFO videos emerged from the region in 2008. We’re sure the UFOs
              were there for the amazing Arabica that they cultivate over there.
              And we agree. Attaca produces some of the finest coffee and we’ve
              got them all to prove our point.

            <h2>Vardha Plantations, India</h2>
            <p>
              Our coffee hunt in South India sprung up a surprise in 2019 when
              we came across Mr. Rajamani Vardha who’s great grandfather
              established Vardha Plantations in Karnataka, India in the late
              1800s on orders of a British general who wanted great coffee. More
              than a century later, Vardha Plantations still produce their
              uniquely amazing blend that has come to be a crowd favourite with
              us.
